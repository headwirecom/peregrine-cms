    <!-- The Export Extensions defines what and how they are exported. The key is the extension of rendering as well as
         the file name. The value is a list of all JCR Primary Types that will be considered to be exported.
         This is an example (for clarity is split the parts into lines):

         data.json=per:Page|per:Template,
         infinity.json=per:Object,
         *~raw=nt:file

         This will export per:Page and per:Template nodes using the .data.json extension, export per:Objects
         using infinity.json and nt:file as themselves (meaning no additional extension) as raw content (~raw).
