We also support server side rendering and bring NodeJS to the enterprise Java World. We
focus on ease of development.

## for backend developers

The current implementation of peregrine is based on Java, Apache Sling and OSGi. Build
at an enterprise quality and scalability level. Due to peregrine's api first approach
and front end rendering capabilities backend developer can focus and provide APIs to
the front end developers and leave the presentation layer to the developers that do the
visual part of an application best.

## technology

Peregrine-cms is a headless cms with a beautiful body and a compelling head. We publish
our APIs allowing for the head and the body of the cms to be decoupled. By using our
published APIs we are able to scale different areas of peregrine at the API level
resulting in a better scalability of the cms and the ability to adapt to the scaling
needs on an individual customer level
